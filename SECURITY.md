## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
All sensitive data is managed through environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: AI model access
- AWS credentials via IAM roles and parameter store
- No hardcoded secrets in source code

### Deployment Security
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS SAM
- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Encrypted storage (S3, DynamoDB)
- CORS configuration for API security
- Parameter-based deployment for sensitive values

### Data Protection
- User content stored securely in AWS S3
- No PII in logs or configuration files
- Comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files
- Template files use generic examples
