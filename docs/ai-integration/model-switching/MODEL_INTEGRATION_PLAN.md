# Model Integration Plan: From Comparison to User Choice

**Project**: FeedMiner Multi-Model AI Integration Enhancement  
**Goal**: Replace separate model comparison page with integrated model selection in upload and results flows  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Created**: August 3, 2025

## üéØ **Project Overview**

Transform FeedMiner's model interaction from a separate comparison page to seamless model selection during upload and dynamic model switching in results. This enhancement will provide users with immediate model choice without sacrificing the educational value of comparing different AI approaches.

### **Current State**
- Separate model testing/comparison page
- Fixed model in main analysis pipeline
- 6 models across 3 families (Claude, Nova, Llama) all functional

### **Target State**
- Model selector in upload flow with cost/performance guidance
- Dynamic model switching on results page with re-analysis
- Consistent UI experience regardless of model choice
- Preserved educational value through model family information

## üö® **Critical Risks & Mitigation**

### **Primary Risk: Output Structure Inconsistencies**
Different models may structure their analysis outputs differently, potentially breaking the frontend UI that expects specific field names, data types, and nested structures.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Comprehensive output standardization layer with validation, transformation, and fallback mechanisms.

### **Secondary Risks**
1. **Performance**: Re-analysis operations adding latency
2. **Cost**: Users accidentally choosing expensive models
3. **UX**: Complex model selection overwhelming users
4. **Reliability**: Model-specific failures breaking core functionality

## üìã **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Output Structure Analysis & Risk Assessment** üîç

**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Goal**: Understand current output differences across all 6 models

#### **1.1 Structure Analysis Tasks**
- [ ] Test all 6 models with identical Instagram data sample
- [ ] Document complete JSON structure for each model family
- [ ] Map field name variations (e.g., `goals` vs `recommendations` vs `suggestions`)
- [ ] Identify data type differences (arrays vs objects, strings vs numbers)
- [ ] Catalog nested structure variations and hierarchy differences
- [ ] Document missing fields by model family

#### **1.2 Frontend Dependency Analysis**
- [ ] Audit `AnalysisDashboard.tsx` for hard-coded field expectations
- [ ] Review `GoalCard.tsx` for required data structure
- [ ] Check `BehavioralPatterns.tsx` and `InterestChart.tsx` dependencies

- **MEDIUM**: Missing features, incomplete data display  
- **LOW**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconsistencies

#### **Deliverables**
- `MODEL_OUTPUT_ANALYSIS.md` with complete structure comparison
