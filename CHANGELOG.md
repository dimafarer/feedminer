- **‚ö° Production Deployment**: Live Strands-based model switching in AWS Lambda environment
  - Performance: 577-935ms individual analysis, 5-6s comparison mode
  - Deployed and verified in production AWS environment
- **üîç Verification Framework**: Comprehensive API authenticity testing suite
  - Provider identity verification, latency pattern analysis
  - Response uniqueness testing, error handling validation
  - Confirms real API usage (not mocked responses)

### Changed - Strands Migration
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from custom `AIProviderManager` to Strands `Agent` patterns
  - New `strands_model_switching.py` replaces `model_switching.py`
  - Proper use of Strands `AnthropicModel` and `BedrockModel` classes
  - Enhanced response extraction for Strands-specific formats
- Updated SAM template handler from `model_switching.handler` to `strands_model_switching.handler`
- Enhanced frontend model testing page to support both test mode and real content comparison
- Improved content listing to properly filter by userId

### Technical Implementation
- **File Updates**: `src/api/strands_model_switching.py`, `template.yaml`, `frontend-demo/src/components/ModelTestingPage.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `strands-agents==0.3.0` and `strands-agents-tools==0.1.9`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains same request/response format for frontend
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation guide in `docs/STRANDS_MODEL_SWITCHING.md`

### Fixed
